> Participants were presented with audiovisually congruent, incongruent or
> McGurk stimuli. Critically, the congruent and incongruent stimuli were
> presented in blocks. Further, the McGurk trials were interspersed either in
> the incongruent or congruent blocks. This enabled us to characterize the
> processes of perceptual integration vs. segregation and their contextual
> modulation by analysing the BOLD-responses to McGurk stimuli in a 2 x 2
> factorial design manipulating (i) top-down prior (in)congruency expectations
> (i.e. McGurk stimuli in incongruent vs. congruent blocks) and (ii)
> participants’ percept: fused McGurk percept vs. segregated auditory percept
> (Figure 1C). Furthermore, we identified ‘bottom-up incongruency’ by comparing
> audiovisually incongruent and congruent trials.
