# Clean code workshop: MATLAB

This workshop aims to show some good coding practices to use with MATLAB or
Octave.

## Requirements

### MATLAB

- it does not need to be recent version
- let me know if you need access to a MATLAB license for the duration of the
  workshop

#### MATLAB toolboxes

Those 2 MATLAB toolboxes will help with running tests and code coverage:

- [MOxUnit](https://github.com/MOxUnit/MOxUnit)
- [MOcov](https://github.com/MOcov/MOcov)

### GIT

- command line or GUI: whatever you prefer
- a [gitlab](https://gitlab.com/) account

### Code editor

A proper code editor will be useful when editing files that are not MATLAB
scripts or functions.

Install [VS-code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

#### VS-code extensions

VS-code has many extensions. Two that may be useful:

- [MATLAB](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Gimly81.matlab)
  allows MATLAB syntax highlighting.
- [error-lens](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=usernamehw.errorlens)
  highlights errors in the code.

### python

- for example installed via conda

#### python packages

- [miss_hit](https://misshit.org/download.html) for MATLAB code style checking,
  formatting and linting
- [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/#installation) for applying code style
  checks before committing
