# Refactoring

<!-- !!! quote "When to refactor"

    [Rule of Three](https://refactoring.guru/refactoring/when)

    - When you’re doing something for the first time, just get it done.
    - When you’re doing something similar for the second time, 
      cringe at having to repeat but do the same thing anyway.
    - When you’re doing something for the third time, start refactoring.
